# ACH Main Website

This is a Gatsby redesign of the Association for Computers and the Humanities website.

## Development

You can run the Gatsby server locally with:

```
npm run develop
```

## Deployment

The site will run out of the box on Netlify. If you use a different platform, you'll need to configure it for Node.js 18 or higher.
