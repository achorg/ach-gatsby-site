**Preamble**
------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear friends and colleagues,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are receiving this newsletter because you are a current member of the Association for Computing and the Humanities (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ACH</span>](http://ach.org)<span style="font-weight: 400;">). The ACH is one of the proud constituent organizations of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ADHO</span>](http://adho.org)<span style="font-weight: 400;">). The ACH seeks to cultivate a vibrant professional community through support of conferences, publications, and outreach activities. Many people contribute to this work, including many of you (e.g. as conference reviewers), as well as members of the ACH Executive Council.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACH Executive Council has invested considerable energy this fall in strategizing about how we might further promote diversity and inclusivity within our community. We believe the ACH is not currently doing enough, nor are we doing enough within the larger ADHO family. ADHO has declared that “inclusivity is a core value” and has established an </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ad hoc Working Group</span>](http://adho.org/announcements/2013/adho-establishes-working-group-inclusivity)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose “purpose is to promote the use of broadly inclusive language and participate in the development or refinement of policies, protocols, and informal practices meant to welcome more diverse constituencies to ADHO and strengthen the organization and field of digital humanities through their involvement.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACH Executive strongly believes that diversity makes us stronger as a community and we’d invite all members to be mindful of this in our own scholarship and in the assessment of the scholarship of others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In that context, we would enthusiastically receive any </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">requests for occasional funding or sponsorship</span>](http://ach.org/activities/grants-and-awards/occasional-funding-sponsorship/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially ones that promote diversity. Our funds our limited, but but we’ll try to support what we can!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">as you may be aware</span>](http://adho.org/announcements/2015/adho-announces-new-steering-committee-chair)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, John Nerbonne resigned this fall as Chair of the ADHO Steering Committee. John worked tirelessly on behalf of ADHO and its constituent organizations (including ACH), and I am deeply grateful for his efforts. Karina van Dalen-Oskam has been elected as the new Chair and the ACH Executive would like to warmly congratulate her and we look forward to her leadership in pursuing our common objectives.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With my very best wishes as your humble ACH President,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stéfan Sinclair</span>

**ACH Elections – Vote by December 10**
---------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ACH members are entitled to vote in this year’s ACH’s election, in which a President, a Vice-President/President-elect, and three Executive Council members will be elected. The terms for all of these positions will begin at the close of the 2016 annual summer Executive Council meeting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the recently amended </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ACH Constitution</span>](http://ach.org/about-ach/constitution/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Vice President serves a two-year term and then becomes the President for an additional two-year term. Since this process is just beginning, a President must be elected for a two-year term. Members of the Executive Council serve four-year terms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">TWO candidates have been nominated to fill the position of PRESIDENT.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">TWO candidates have been nominated to fill the position of VICE-PRESIDENT/PRESIDENT-ELECT.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">TEN candidates have been nominated to fill three positions of EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be entitled to vote for only ONE candidate for the positions of PRESIDENT and VICE-PRESIDENT, and for up to THREE candidates for the position of EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OFFICER.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections began at midday on November 20, 2015 and end at midnight GMT on December 10 2015. Details of all the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">candidates can be found on the ACH website</span>](http://ach.org/news/2015/11/candidate-statements/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, or by clicking on the candidate links in the Online Voting Form.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To place your vote online, you will need your Subscription Number and your unique Voting Token sent to you by email. The token ensures that each member may vote only once and that the results are submitted anonymously. All queries and questions about the elections should be addressed to the Chair of the Nominations Committee, Élika Ortega (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">elections@ach.org</span>](mailto:elections@ach.org)<span style="font-weight: 400;">).
