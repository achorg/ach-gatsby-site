Thanks to all of the contributors to our Pedagogy Lightning Talks at the ACH AGM at [DH2013](http://dh2013.unl.edu/). A tremendous wealth of creativity and experience was shared in a short 15 minutes, and the slides will very shortly be posted on this site.

In the meantime, though, here is the wonderfully witty poem that provided a wonderful capstone to the lightning presentations.

**Some people believe in the “new new new thing”**  
**That we know as DH — but I’d like to bring**

**Something older and wiser to the next generation:**  
**DH history, tradition, respect, veneration.**

**Willa Cather, whose homeland is hosting, my dears,**  
**Has inspired my title: O DH Pioneers!**

**I tell DH students of Busa and Bush**  
**(that’s Roberto and Vannevar — not George Dubya, whoosh!)**

**I like them to know Michael Sperberg-McQueen,**  
**And then claim XML as his DH machine.**

**I also proclaim, from my own institution,**  
**A somewhat less famous DH contribution:**

**My very own colleague, Elijah R. Meeks,**  
**Who gave Wikipedia its first DH tweaks.**

**But something is missing: No need to be prudish:**  
**These DH pioneers are all whitish, and dudish!**

**DH women and people of color — we’ve got ’em!**  
**I’d like to suggest that it’s time that we taught ’em.**

**To enhance our rich history with something less cursory:**  
**Not only more History, but also more Herstory.**
