<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) invites nominations for the 2019 elections, in which our members will elect </span>**three Executive Council members for four­-year terms (2019-2023)**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We seek candidates eager to support and advance the field of digital humanities (DH) by helping to lead the ACH.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**Activities:** ACH officers and Executive Council members develop and uphold ACH policies, determine and distribute funding, and oversee all organizational activities. Planned activities for 2019 include the inaugural ACH conference; a membership drive; various facets of our mentorship program and job slams; advocacy work; publications including the </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanist </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">listserv, </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Humanities Quarterly</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">DH Slack</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">; collaborations with ADHO partners in the annual DH conference and other professional activities; co-­administration of a number of prestigious DH awards, distribution of student bursaries for DH training and education, as well as other priorities as set by the ACH membership. You can be involved in helping ACH programs succeed by nominating either yourself or someone else to be an active participant in the leadership of the Association.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**Eligibility and expectations:** To stand for election as an Executive Council member or officer, candidates must be members in good standing of the ACH at the time of nomination, or be willing to become members post-election. They commit to being present at annual Council meetings at the Digital Humanities Conference, whether in person or virtually, and to participating in discussions during the rest of the year by email and audio/video conference. Council members are expected to be active in the digital humanities community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**Seeking a diverse slate of nominees:** We welcome participants not just from universities and colleges, but also galleries, libraries, museums, community groups, and other organizations engaged with digital humanities. We also welcome nominations of people from all constituencies and humanities disciplines, and especially encourage the nomination of women, people of color, LGBTQ, or other under­represented groups. Demonstrated commitment to the organization and/or to the field counts for more with our membership than professional affiliation, academic status, or job title.</span>
