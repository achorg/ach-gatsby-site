## The Call for Hosts for ACH2021 is Open!

ACH invites expressions of interest from potential hosts for its 2021 conference. The ACH Conference is the biennial conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the US-based member organization of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). The ACH Conference aims to provide a forum for conversations that accommodate an expansive definition of digital humanities in a broad array of subject areas, methods, and communities of practice. Visit the [ACH2021 conference website](http://ach2021.ach.org/) to learn more.

## The 2019 Association for Computers and the Humanities Conference

ACH held its 2019 conference, [ACH2019](http://ach2019.ach.org), in **Pittsburgh, PA, July 23-26, 2019** at the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center. We partnered with Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, the University of Pittsburgh, and KeystoneDH for this exciting event.

## ADHO Digital Humanities Conference

ACH is delighted to serve as a partner in the annual [international Digital Humanities conference](http://adho.org/conference). The Digital Humanities conference welcomes digital humanities scholars and practitioners from a huge range of disciplines and professional areas: faculty and students, librarians, archivists, technologists, project and center directors, and many more. The conference is broadly international and interdisciplinary in scope.

Contributions to the conference take a variety of forms and may be deliberately experimental: papers (long and short), posters and demos, panel discussions, and social media. Selected presentations are published as a special issue of LLC and may appear in other ADHO journals as well.

[Student bursaries](http://adho.org/awards/Conference%20Bursary%20Awards) are available to help defray travel costs.
