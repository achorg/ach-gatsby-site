Each year, the Association for Computers and the Humanities **sponsors digital humanities sessions** at the [Modern Language Association Convention](http://www.mla.org/convention). We also **compile a list of sessions** with digital-humanities talks at the Convention. Some of these sessions contain only one or two relevant talks, but the list includes the entire program for each session.

The talks for each year are posted shortly before the MLA convention, and remain up to serve as an archive.

There are two lists, one of sessions sponsored by the ACH, and one of all sessions with talks of digital humanities interest.
