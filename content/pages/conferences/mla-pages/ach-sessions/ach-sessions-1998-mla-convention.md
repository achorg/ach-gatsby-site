The Content-Provider as Colleague: Creating Institutional Spaces for New Media Teaching and Research
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presiding: [Matthew G. Kirschenbaum](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/~mgk3k/), University of Virginia

This panel will address the apparent contradiction between the casual enthusiasm for new media technologies increasingly evident among members of the profession, and the material resistance scholars working with those very same technologies often encounter when attempting to secure professional rewards, departmental support, and administrative commitments. The panel rests on the assumption that without sufficient institutional space (and time) for new media work, humanities computing will cede current footholds in literary and cultural studies to the commercial infotainment industry.
