<div>Scale and Scholarship in the Digital Humanities
-----------------------------------------------

Thursday, 29 December 2005, 3:30–4:45 p.m., Eisenhower Room, Marriott

Speakers from large-scale and small-scale digitization programs that provide full-text access to humanities materials will address the question of how the scope of their undertakings affect not only their modes of production but also the type of research scholars can and should conduct online. What are the long-term scholarly implications of aggregating and presenting research materials millions of works at time vs. meting them out in smaller, deeply encoded units? How are these projects responding to and/or establishing the methods that researchers use when conducting digital research? In what way does the scale and depth of digital content necessitate different modes of interaction and what kind of scholarship will these modes produce?
