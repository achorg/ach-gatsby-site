Humanities Computing Sessions – MLA 1996
-----------------------------------------

[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 1996 Modern Language Association Convention (in Washington, DC, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

Although the 1996 convention is now in the past, this guide will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](digital-humanities-sessions).

364: Computers and Style
-------------------------

Sunday, 29 December 1996, 10:15 to 11:30 a.m.; Calvert Room, Sheraton Washington Hotel

Program arranged by the Discussion Group on Computer Studies in Language and Literature. Presiding: Joseph Rudman, Carnegie Mellon University

- "Mutations of the Narrative Voice: Gary/Ajar," Vina Tirvengadum, University of Manitoba > Many experts from Buffon to Barthes postulate that a writer's style is dictated by the subconscious and forms the genetic fingerprint of the writer's work. It would therefore follow that pseudonymous works should contain the genetic fingerprint of the original writer and that there should be no significant difference between the style of Romain Gary and that of Emile Ajar. However, the two applications of author recognition, namely (1) authorship attribution and (2) chronological studies have made contradictory claims, the former stating that the unconscious aspect of a writer's style remains constant throughout his/her life, the latter claiming that the unconscious features change throughout the author's life and develop rectilinearly which then allow a work to be dated.
- "A Computerized Analysis of Shakespeare's Verse by a Connectionist Model of Poetic Meter," Malcolm Hayward, Indiana University of Pennsylvania > This paper describes the analysis of a large sample (1500 lines) of Shakespeare's verse by a computerized, connectionist model of poetic meter. Three related issues regarding Shakespeare's meter are explored: chronological development (early, middle, and late styles), stylistic distinctions within genres (comedies, histories, and tragedies), and attribution issues (concerning disputed works in the Shakespeare canon).
- "Language and Style in Golding's <cite>The Inheritors</cite>: An Eclectic, Computer-Assisted Approach," David L. Hoover, New York University > In "Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's <cite>The Inheritors</cite>," M. A. K. Halliday analyzes the style of Golding's second novel. He claims that the selection of clause-types, the use of body parts and inanimate objects as agents, and the restricted diction create a kind of Neanderthal worldview that dominates most of the novel.
> 
>  Stanley Fish attacked this article in his challenging but often misguided "What is Stylistics and Why are they Saying Such Terrible Things about it?" I found Halliday's approach attractive but his conclusions doubtful and Fish's critique unconvincing, and decided to examine Halliday's claims more closely. I concluded that the approach was effective and fruitful, but the results were flawed because of insufficient analysis, and decided to rectify this problem by performing a fuller, computer-assisted analysis of the novel.
