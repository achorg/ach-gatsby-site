Digital Humanities Sessions – MLA 2013
--------------------------------------

The trend in previous years of an abundance of digital humanities sessions at the MLA continues in 2013. There are 65 sessions in all. And unlike when this list began to be compiled, in the main, the entire session is devoted to DH talks.

Mark Sample has compiled this list of sessions with digital-humanities talks for the Modern Language Association Convention (in Boston from January 3-6) and the ACH graciously acknowledges his generosity in allowing us to reprint his listing. Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to Susan.Schreibman at gmail.com
