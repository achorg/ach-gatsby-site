[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](/) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 1998 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in San Francisco, California, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in  
order to attend any of these talks. But two sessions are free and open to the public: [A Performance of Hypermedia Poetry and Fiction by Stephanie Strickland and M. D. Coverley](#session667), and [Cyber Ed: Academic Labor and Technology](#session581a).

Although the 1998 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](?q=node/25).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to [John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk).
