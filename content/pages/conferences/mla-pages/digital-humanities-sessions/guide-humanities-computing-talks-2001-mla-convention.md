title: 'Guide to Humanities-Computing Talks at the 2001 MLA Convention'
date: '2010-04-22'
---
[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 2001 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in New Orleans, Louisiana, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in order to attend any of these talks. But the following sessions are free and open to the public: [“Teaching Smarter”](#session586) and [“*American Sign Language Dictionary and Inflection Guide*: A Demonstration of the CD-ROM”](#session596). MLA talks are published at the discretion of their authors; if you want to obtain the text of a talk you were unable to attend, the best method is to contact the author directly.

Although the 2001 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](?q=node/25).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to <John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk>.
