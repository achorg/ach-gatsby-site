Digital Humanities Sessions – MLA 2012
---------------------------------------

The trend in previous years of an abundance of digital humanities sessions at the MLA continues in 2012, with up to six competing panels in one session. Please look out for the informal 'Reconfiguring' series — sessions by the MLA's Committee on Scholarly Editions and the ACH in re-evaluating scholarly practice within new digital paradigms.

[Mark Sample ](http://www.samplereality.com/)has compiled this list of sessions with digital-humanities talks for the [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in Seattle from January 5-8) and the ACH graciously acknowledges his generosity in allowing us to reprint his listing. Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to Susan.Schreibman at gmail.com

Open-access models of publishing are creating new models for content creation and distribution as small print-focused presses are experiencing a renaissance. Come see!

In 2010 the Executive Council appointed a working group to explore the state of the doctoral dissertation: How can it adapt to digital innovation, open access, new concepts of “authorship”? What counts as scholarship in the world today? How do we address the national problems of cost and time to degree? This roundtable will offer members of the working group an opportunity to make the case that as we shift the terminology from scholarly publication to scholarly communication we need to expand the forms of the dissertation and to reconceptualize what the dissertation is and how it can prepare graduates for academic careers in the coming decades.
