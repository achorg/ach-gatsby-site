date: '2010-04-22'
---
[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](/) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 1999 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in Chicago, Illinois, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in order to attend any of these talks. But two sessions are free and open to the public: [“A Reading of Collaborative Texts from the World Wide Web”](#session349), and [“Chaucer Futures: Graduate Study in the Twenty-First Century”](#session626).

Although the 1999 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](?q=node/25).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to [John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk](John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk).
