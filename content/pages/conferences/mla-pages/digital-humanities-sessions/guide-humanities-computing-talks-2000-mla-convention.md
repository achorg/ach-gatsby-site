[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 2000 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in Washington, DC, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in order to attend any of these talks. But the following sessions are free and open to the public: [“From Gutenberg to Gates: Metamorphoses of Media”](#session122), [“The Impact of the Internet on East Asian Literatures and Cultures”](#session127), [“The Humanities at Work: PhDs and New Media”](#session174A), [“The Humanities at Work: University Innovators”](#session266), [“Still Reading in the New Millennium: A Conversation”](#session321), [“The Humanities at Work: Postacademic Culture Shock”](#session413), and [“Writing and Schooling at the Millennium”](#session484).

Although the 2000 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](?q=node/25).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to <John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk>.
