date: '2010-04-22'
---
[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://ach.org) has compiled this list of sessions with computing-related talks at the 1997 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in Toronto, Ontario, from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two computing-related talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in order to attend any of these talks. But a few sessions are free and open to the public: [Revolution or Evolution? Electronic Resources in the Humanities](#session97); [Electronic Texts in the Humanities](#session308); [The Refereed Electronic Journal](#session343); and [Literary Theory and Children’s Literature: Reflections on the Past and Predictions for the Future](#session624).

Although the 1997 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](?q=node/25).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to [John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk](John.Lavagnino@kcl.ac.uk).
