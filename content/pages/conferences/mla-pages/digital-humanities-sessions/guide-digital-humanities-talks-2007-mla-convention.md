title: 'Guide to Digital-Humanities Talks at the 2007 MLA Convention'
date: '2010-04-22'
---
Digital Humanities Sessions – MLA 2007
---------------------------------------

[The Association for Computers and the Humanities](/) has compiled this list of sessions with digital-humanities talks at the 2007 [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/) Convention (in Chicago from December 27 through 30). Some of these sessions contain only one or two relevant talks, but this list includes the entire program for each session.

In most cases you must pay the convention-registration fee in order to attend these talks. But three sessions are free and open to the public: [“Professionalization in a Digital Age”](#session256), [“Scholarship in New Media”](#session373), and [“Keywords for a Digital Profession”](#session472). MLA talks are published at the discretion of their authors; if you want to obtain the text of a talk you were unable to attend, the best method is to contact the author directly.

Although the 2007 convention is now in the past, this information will remain available, as a record of what went on. Similar information for many other years is available via [the main page on ACH MLA sessions](digital-humanities-sessions).

Corrections and additions are welcome; please send them to John.Lavagnino at kcl.ac.uk.

N.

This poster session provides the opportunity for attendees to engage firsthand with works of electronic literature, to meet with electronic literature authors and theorists, and to engage with interactive computer presentations of their work. Presenters will exhibit their work simultaneously, creating ample opportunity for discussion and demonstration.

A variety of new tools are being developed that are designed to let scholars literally see text in new ways. Displays of word occurrences, pattern distribution, collocation, and textual genesis can yield insights about a text that might not be revealed or as easily comprehended without the visual element.

This poster session provides the opportunity for attendees to engage firsthand with visualization tools, to meet with the scholars who develop and use them, and to engage with interactive computer presentations of these tools. Presenters will exhibit their work simultaneously, creating ample opportunity for discussion and demonstration.
