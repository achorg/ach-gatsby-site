As a professional association for the digital humanities, ACH performs an important advocacy role. We develop and share position papers on issues of importance to our members, partner with other organizations to advocate for key positions, and support initiatives (such as 4Humanities) that help track and intervene in the central political debates that affect our work.

Recent advocacy activities include:

- Publishing [ACH Guidelines for Assessment of Digital Scholarship in Tenure and Promotion](/news/2019/09/ach-guidelines-for-assessment-of-digital-scholarship-in-tenure-and-promotion/)
- Releasing a [Statement in the Aftermath of the 2016 Election](/news/2016/12/ach-statement-in-the-aftermath-of-the-2016-election/)
