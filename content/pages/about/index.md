The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) is the US-based professional society for the digital humanities. We support and disseminate research and cultivate a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities.

We welcome members of any academic affiliation or professional role who are interested in the digital humanities and who would like to help shape the values and priorities of our organization, which are centered on the needs and interests of US-based DH practitioners. For practitioners in other parts of the world, we encourage you to [explore the constituent organizations of ADHO](https://www.adho.org) to find the one that's the best fit for you.

Through its publications, conferences, workshops, outreach, training opportunities, and other mentoring activities, ACH aims to offer assistance to members at all levels of experience. Its support of open-access publications and open-source tools are part of its mission to increase access to scholarly work in the digital humanities and in the academy more broadly.

## Digital Humanities

ACH advocates for and supports all of our members in their digital humanities work. Digital humanities is a broad term encompassing a wide range of subject domains, methods, and communities of practice, including (but not limited to) computer-assisted research, pedagogy, and software; resource creation, curation, and engagement; physical computing; the use of digital technologies to write, publish, and review scholarship; and humanistic research into and about digital objects and culture. ACH recognizes that this work is inherently and inextricably sociopolitical, and thus advocates for social change through the use of computers and related technologies in the study of humanistic subjects.

ACH has created the [ACH Guidelines for Assessment of Digital Scholarship in Tenure and Promotion](/news/2019/09/ach-guidelines-for-assessment-of-digital-scholarship-in-tenure-and-promotion/), which aim to help candidates and committees assess (and prepare to assess) digital scholarship.

## Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations

ACH is the US-based member of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](https://adho.org) (ADHO) consortium. As part of ADHO, ACH sponsors publications, events, and activities in support of the digital humanities.
