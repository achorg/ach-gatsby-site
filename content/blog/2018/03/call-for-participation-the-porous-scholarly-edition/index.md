<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a joint session proposed by the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Association for Computers and the Humanities</span>](http://ach.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions</span>](https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Publications/Committee-on-Scholarly-Editions)<span style="font-weight: 400;">; official CFP here: </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">https://apps.mla.org/cfp\_detail\_11429</span>](https://apps.mla.org/cfp_detail_11429)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Has the scholarly edition become more porous as a result of the digital turn? This panel seeks reflections and provocations on the way that the boundaries of scholarly editions have changed or should change. We solicit presentations that will address such questions as:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">In what ways can editions be dynamic, in terms of temporality, media, or delivery?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">What are innovative ways of handling versioning?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How do hyperlinking and other digital technologies affect the putative boundaries of the scholarly edition?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How is “external” content, whether manually or automatically harvested, related to scholarly editions?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How is the authority or singularity of the editor changing in the context of digital scholarly editions?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">What role might citizen scholarship play in relation to scholarly editions?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How ought credit to be handled in when digital editions involve collaboration with others, whether they are scholars, students, designers, or technical contributors?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How does annotation impact digital scholarly editions?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">In what ways are editorial control and processes impacted?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Presentations that take up specific projects are welcome but presentations should focus on one or more of the above questions rather than general demonstrations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We welcome 12 minute papers. We also welcome proposals for non-traditional presentation that would fit within this time constraint. Please send 300-word abstracts plus bio(s) of the presenter(s) to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">sbrown@uoguelph.ca</span>](mailto:sbrown@uoguelph.ca)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">lrhody@gc.cuny.edu</span>](mailto:lrhody@gc.cuny.edu)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by March 15th.
